        <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>
              Are virtual reality glasses compatible with all smartphones, or do
              they require specific models?
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Virtual reality glasses typically require smartphones with
              specific specifications to ensure compatibility. While some VR
              glasses support a wide range of devices, others are designed to
              work with particular models. It's essential to check the
              compatibility list provided by the VR glasses manufacturer before
              purchasing.

          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>
              What factors should I consider when buying a new computer to
              ensure longevity and performance?
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              When purchasing a new computer, consider factors such as the
              processor speed, amount of RAM, storage type (SSD recommended for
              faster performance), graphics card capability (especially for
              gaming or design work), and the operating system. Additionally,
              investing in a quality warranty and regularly updating software
              and hardware can help maintain performance over time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>
              Is it worth repairing a damaged cell phone, or should I opt for a
              replacement?
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Whether to repair or replace a damaged cell phone depends on the
              extent of the damage, the age of the device, and the cost of
              repairs versus the cost of a new phone. Minor issues like a
              cracked screen or battery replacement are often worth repairing,
              while extensive damage or outdated models may warrant a
              replacement, especially if it affects performance or usability.

          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>
              Can virtual reality glasses cause any adverse effects on eyesight
              with prolonged use?
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Prolonged use of virtual reality glasses can potentially cause eye
              strain, discomfort, or motion sickness in some individuals. To
              minimize these effects, take regular breaks, adjust the settings
              for optimal comfort, and ensure the glasses fit properly to
              prevent excessive pressure on the eyes. If you experience
              persistent discomfort, it's advisable to limit usage and consult
              with a healthcare professional.
